the app has 3 files in the same folder:


flickr.php - the HTML page

flickr.js - used to accept the Flickr REST API request data & show it in the browser

flickr.css


1. load flickr.php in the browser through running localhost Apache server. for example: localhost/holidayextras/flickr.php
2. double click flickr.php to open it in a browser without running localhost on Apache server
