There are 2 solutions - one without AngularJS and one with AngularJS

First solution location : /holiday_extras/flickr.php
It has 3 files in the same folder: flickr.php - the HTML page, 
flickr.js - used to accept the Flickr REST API request data & show it in the browser,
flickr.css
1. load flickr.php in the browser through running localhost Apache server. for example: localhost/holidayextras/flickr.php
2. double click flickr.php to open it in a browser without running localhost on Apache server


Second solution location : /holiday_extras/angular_solution/flickr.php	
Files are distributed in their respective folders inside the "angular_solution" folder
1. load flickr.php in the browser through running localhost Apache server. for example: localhost/holidayextras/angular_solution/flickr.php
